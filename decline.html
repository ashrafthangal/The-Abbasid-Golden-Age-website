      <h2>Political Fragmentation</h2>
    <p> The sheer size of the Abbasid Caliphate made centralized governance increasingly difficult. By the 9th century, regional governors, military leaders, and local rulers began to claim autonomy. Provinces such as Egypt, Spain, and North Africa broke away and established independent dynasties, reducing the reach of Abbasid authority. The rise of local powers like the Fatimids in North Africa and the Umayyads in Andalusia further divided the Muslim world. Over time, the caliphs in Baghdad lost control over these regions, which made it hard for the Abbasids to maintain a unified empire.</p>

    <h2>Invasions and Internal Conflicts</h2>
    <p>The Abbasid Caliphate also suffered from frequent external invasions and internal rebellions. The Seljuk Turks gained influence in the 11th century, and although they protected the caliphs, they also took control of key administrative functions. Additionally, factionalism within the court weakened the stability of the government. Religious and ethnic divisions between Arab, Persian, and Turkish groups added further complexity. The constant internal conflict among court factions and provinces gradually eroded the caliphate’s power and authority.</p>

    <h2>Mongol Invasion and the Fall of Baghdad</h2>
    <p> The final blow to the Abbasid Caliphate came in 1258 when the Mongols, under the leadership of Hulagu Khan, invaded Baghdad. The Mongols destroyed the city, looted its wealth, and massacred much of the population, including scholars and officials. Caliph Al-Musta'sim was captured and executed, bringing an end to Abbasid rule in Baghdad. The House of Wisdom, one of the greatest centers of knowledge in the world, was destroyed, marking a tragic end to the city’s intellectual and cultural dominance..</p>

    <h2>Survival in Cairo</h2>
    <p> Although the Abbasid Caliphate ended in Baghdad, the Mamluks of Egypt later established a symbolic Abbasid caliphate in Cairo. This version of the caliphate held no real political power and was limited to religious and ceremonial functions. The Abbasid caliphs in Cairo served as spiritual figureheads, giving legitimacy to Mamluk rule. This symbolic survival of the Abbasid title maintained a connection to the Islamic tradition of caliphal authority, even though real power remained with the Mamluk sultans.</p>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>  Despite the political decline and fall of the Abbasid Caliphate, its cultural and intellectual achievements left a lasting impact on the Muslim world. The translation of Greek, Persian, and Indian texts into Arabic during the Abbasid era enriched Islamic knowledge and laid the foundations for advancements in science, philosophy, and medicine. The Abbasid legacy is remembered as a period of flourishing arts and learning that shaped the course of Islamic civilization for centuries, influencing both the Muslim world and the broader global intellectual heritage.</p>
