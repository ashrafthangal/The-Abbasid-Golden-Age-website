        <h2>Scientific Achievements</h2>
        <p>During the Abbasid Golden Age, scientists made significant advances in astronomy, medicine, mathematics, and chemistry. Figures like Al-Khwarizmi, Al-Razi, and Ibn al-Haytham were pioneers in their fields.</p>

        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>Al-Khwarizmi, often referred to as the "father of algebra," introduced new mathematical concepts that formed the basis of modern algebra and algorithm development.</p>

        <h3>Medicine</h3>
        <p>Islamic physicians during the Abbasid era, such as Al-Razi and Ibn Sina (Avicenna), wrote medical encyclopedias and developed treatments for various diseases that would later influence European medicine.</p>

<h2>Baghdad's Golden Age Achievements</h2>
        <p>During the height of the Abbasid Caliphate, Baghdad was not only the capital of the Islamic world but also the cultural, scientific, and intellectual hub of the globe. From the 8th to the 13th century, Baghdad was at the center of what is often referred to as the Islamic Golden Age, a period marked by immense advancements in knowledge and culture. The achievements made in science, medicine, philosophy, art, and architecture left a lasting legacy, influencing both the Islamic world and the West for centuries to come.</p>

        <h3>House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikmah)</h3>
        <p>One of Baghdad’s most significant achievements during the Golden Age was the establishment of the House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikmah), founded by Caliph Harun al-Rashid and expanded by his son, Al-Ma’mun. The House of Wisdom was a major intellectual center where scholars from diverse cultural and religious backgrounds worked together to translate, preserve, and expand upon ancient Greek, Persian, Indian, and Chinese knowledge. The work done here laid the foundation for future scientific and philosophical advancements across the world.</p>

        <h3>Scientific Discoveries</h3>
        <p>Baghdad became a center of scientific discovery. Scholars such as Al-Khwarizmi, a mathematician and astronomer, laid the foundations of algebra, which would later spread to Europe. He also introduced the Arabic numeral system, which replaced Roman numerals in the West, greatly influencing the future of mathematics. Baghdad’s scholars made significant contributions in astronomy, including accurate calculations of the Earth's circumference and advancements in understanding the solar system.</p>

        <h3>Medicine and Healthcare</h3>
        <p>Medical advancements were another hallmark of Baghdad’s Golden Age. Pioneering doctors like Al-Razi and Ibn Sina (Avicenna) wrote medical texts that would be used as standard references in both the Islamic and European worlds for centuries. Al-Razi’s "Kitab al-Hawi" (Comprehensive Book of Medicine) and Ibn Sina’s "Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb" (The Canon of Medicine) were groundbreaking works in understanding diseases, anatomy, and treatment techniques. Baghdad’s hospitals, known as bimaristans, were among the most advanced in the world, providing free healthcare to the public and serving as training centers for medical students.</p>

        <h3>Astronomy and Mathematics</h3>
        <p>Baghdad’s scholars made important strides in astronomy. Observatories were established to track celestial bodies, and Al-Battani refined measurements of the Earth’s axial tilt and the length of the solar year. His work, along with others, paved the way for advancements in trigonometry. Baghdad was also a hub for mathematics, particularly algebra and arithmetic. Al-Khwarizmi’s contributions in algebra are still acknowledged today, as he introduced systematic methods for solving linear and quadratic equations.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Flourishing</h2>
        <p>Baghdad was a vibrant cultural center where the arts flourished. The city was home to poets, musicians, and artists who contributed to a rich tapestry of Islamic art and literature. The famous tales of "One Thousand and One Nights" reflect the cultural exchanges and cosmopolitan nature of the Abbasid capital.</p>

        <h3>Literature and Poetry</h3>
        <p>Arabic literature saw its golden age during this period, with works that explored love, philosophy, politics, and science. Poets like Abu Nuwas and Al-Mutanabbi became celebrated figures, producing works that are still revered in Arabic literary tradition today. Baghdad was also the home of great prose writers, including Al-Jahiz, known for his work "Kitab al-Hayawan" (The Book of Animals), which explored zoology in a unique literary style.</p>

        <h3>Architecture and Urban Development</h3>
        <p>Under Abbasid rule, Baghdad grew into a sprawling city with monumental architecture. The city was originally designed as a perfect circle, a symbol of the Abbasid Caliphate's power and unity. Though this circular city, built by Caliph Al-Mansur, was later expanded, its design influenced Islamic architecture for centuries. The construction of the Great Mosque of Samarra, with its unique spiral minaret, was another architectural achievement that demonstrated the grandeur and ambition of the Abbasids.</p>

        <h2>Philosophy and Intellectual Exchange</h2>
        <p>Baghdad was also a center for philosophical thought, where Islamic, Greek, Persian, and Indian ideas were debated and synthesized. Al-Kindi, known as the "Philosopher of the Arabs," was one of the first major Islamic philosophers to incorporate Greek philosophical methods with Islamic theology. Later, philosophers like Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina continued this tradition, making significant contributions to logic, metaphysics, and ethics. The works of Aristotle and Plato were translated into Arabic, allowing Baghdad’s scholars to engage deeply with Greek philosophy, which they built upon with their own original ideas.</p>

        <h3>Religious Thought</h3>
        <p>Baghdad’s Golden Age also saw the rise of important religious scholarship. Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh), theology (kalam), and Sufism all flourished in the city. Scholars such as Imam Abu Hanifa laid the foundations of the Hanafi school of thought, one of the major Islamic legal traditions. Meanwhile, theological debates between different sects of Islam, such as the Mu'tazilites and Ash'arites, were a significant feature of intellectual life in Baghdad.</p>

        <h2>Decline and End of the Golden Age</h2>
        <p>Despite its achievements, Baghdad’s Golden Age gradually declined due to internal strife, administrative inefficiencies, and external pressures. The Mongol invasion of 1258, led by Hulagu Khan, marked the end of Baghdad’s preeminence as the intellectual and cultural capital of the Islamic world. The sacking of Baghdad resulted in the destruction of libraries, including the House of Wisdom, and many scholars were killed or fled to other parts of the Islamic world.</p>

        <h2>Legacy of Baghdad's Golden Age</h2>
        <p>Though Baghdad’s Golden Age ended in tragedy, its contributions to world history were profound. The knowledge produced and preserved by Baghdad’s scholars was crucial to the development of modern science, medicine, mathematics, and philosophy. Much of the Greek, Persian, and Indian knowledge translated and expanded upon in Baghdad found its way to Europe, where it would eventually spark the Renaissance. Today, the legacy of Baghdad’s Golden Age is remembered as one of the most important periods of intellectual and cultural achievement in human history.</p>
